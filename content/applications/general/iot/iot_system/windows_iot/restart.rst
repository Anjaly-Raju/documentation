Restart Windows IoT
===================

In some instances a manual restart of the physical :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box can resolve
the issue of an :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box not showing up on the database. For the Windows
virtual :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box a manual restart of the Odoo server can resolve
database connection issues.

To restart the virtual Windows IoT server:

#. Type `Services` into the Windows :guilabel:`Search Bar`.
#. Select the :menuselection:`Services` App and scroll down to the :guilabel:`Odoo` service.
#. Right click on :guilabel:`Odoo` and select :guilabel:`Start` or :guilabel:`Restart`. This action
   will manually restart the Odoo IoT server.
